# # Face Generation
# In this project, you'll use generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces.
# ### Get the Data
# You'll be using two datasets in this project:
# - MNIST
# - CelebA
# 
# Since the celebA dataset is complex and you're doing GANs in a project for the first time, we want you to test your neural network on MNIST before CelebA.  Running the GANs on MNIST will allow you to see how well your model trains sooner.
# 
# If you're using [FloydHub](https://www.floydhub.com/), set `data_dir` to "/input" and use the [FloydHub data ID](http://docs.floydhub.com/home/using_datasets/) "R5KrjnANiKVhLWAkpXhNBe".

# ### CelebA
# The [CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA)](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) dataset contains over 200,000 celebrity images with annotations.

# ## Preprocess the Data
# Since the project's main focus is on building the GANs, we'll preprocess the data for you.  The values of the MNIST and CelebA dataset will be in the range of -0.5 to 0.5 of 28x28 dimensional images.  The CelebA images will be cropped to remove parts of the image that don't include a face, then resized down to 28x28.
# 
# The MNIST images are black and white images with a single [color channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_(digital_image%29) while the CelebA images have [3 color channels (RGB color channel)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_(digital_image%29#RGB_Images).
# ## Build the Neural Network
# You'll build the components necessary to build a GANs by implementing the following functions below:
# - `model_inputs`
# - `discriminator`
# - `generator`
# - `model_loss`
# - `model_opt`
# - `train`
